# System Patterns

*   **Architecture Overview:** [Provide a high-level description or diagram (e.g., using Mermaid) of the system architecture.]
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Client] --> B(API Gateway)
        B --> C{Service 1}
        B --> D{Service 2}
        C --> E[Database]
        D --> E
    ```
*   **Key Technical Decisions:**
    *   [Decision 1: Rationale]
    *   [Decision 2: Rationale]
*   **Design Patterns:** [List major design patterns used (e.g., MVC, Observer, Singleton) and where.]
*   **Component Relationships:** [Describe how major components interact.]

*This document outlines the technical structure, core decisions, and patterns governing the system.*
